# Hangman Game
<br>
A word guessing game where the word to guess is represented by a row of dashes representing each letter or number of the word. If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, it appears in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, one element of a hanged stick figure is added as a tally mark. Generally, the game ends once the word is guessed, or if the stick figure is complete - man is hanged!
